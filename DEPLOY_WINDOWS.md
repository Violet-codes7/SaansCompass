# Deploy Saans Compass from Windows

About 20 minutes the first time. Run every command in **PowerShell** from the project folder. Never paste keys or passwords into chat.

## 1. Install the tools (once)
1. **AWS CLI v2**: download and run https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi
2. **SAM CLI**: download and run the 64-bit installer from https://github.com/aws/aws-sam-cli/releases/latest/download/AWS_SAM_CLI_64_PY3.msi
3. Close PowerShell and open a new one so both are on PATH. Check:
   ```powershell
   aws --version
   sam --version
   ```

## 2. Get the latest code
```powershell
cd <your AirCompass folder>
git pull
E:\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1          # the Python 3.12 venv you already made
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python --version                      # must say 3.12.x
```
If `Activate.ps1` is blocked, run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned` once and try again.

## 3. Sign in to AWS
```powershell
aws login --region ap-south-1
```
A browser opens; sign in with your normal AWS console user (not root if you can avoid it). Then check:
```powershell
aws sts get-caller-identity
```
It should print your account number. If your CLI says `login` is not a command, update the CLI (step 1.1), or use `aws configure sso`.

## 4. Turn on Claude in Bedrock (once)
Console → switch region to **Asia Pacific (Mumbai) ap-south-1** → Amazon Bedrock → Model catalog → **Claude Opus 5.5** → enable / request access. Anthropic asks for a short use-case form the first time ("hackathon demo, air-quality advice app" is fine).
You can skip this; the site still works, it just hides the "In plain words" box.

## 5. Build and deploy
Keep the venv active (sam build uses the Python 3.12 on PATH).
```powershell
sam build
sam deploy --guided
```
Answer the questions like this:

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Stack Name | `saans-compass` (press Enter) |
| AWS Region | `ap-south-1` (press Enter) |
| Parameter BudgetEmail | your email (gets a warning if spend passes $0.80), or Enter to skip |
| Parameter AlarmEmail | your email, or Enter to skip |
| Parameter BedrockModel | press Enter (keeps `anthropic.claude-opus-5-5`) |
| Parameter BedrockRegion | press Enter (`ap-south-1`) |
| Confirm changes before deploy | `y` |
| Allow SAM CLI IAM role creation | `y` |
| Disable rollback | `n` |
| WebFunction has no authentication. Is this okay? | `y` (it is a public website; asked once per route) |
| Save arguments to configuration file | `y`, then Enter for the defaults |

When it shows the change set, type `y`. At the end it prints **Outputs**. Copy `SiteUrl` and send it in the thread.

Next time you only need `sam build` and `sam deploy` (no `--guided`).

## 6. Test the alert
1. Open the `SiteUrl`, open a plan, enter your email under alerts and subscribe.
2. Click the confirmation link in the email from AWS Notifications.
3. Send an alert now:
   ```powershell
   sam remote invoke AlertFunction --stack-name saans-compass --event-file events/today.json
   ```
   An area only emails when its plan changed since the last run, so the first run always sends.

## If something fails
- **`sam build` fails on a long path:** make sure LongPathsEnabled is on (we did this for pip), or move the project to a short folder like `E:\ac`.
- **`sam build` says Python 3.12 not found:** activate the venv first (step 2).
- **Deploy fails with "not authorized":** your AWS user needs admin rights for the deploy.
- **The summary box says "not available":** Bedrock access (step 4) is not enabled yet.
- Anything else: paste the last 20 lines of the error in the thread (no keys).

## Remove everything after the hackathon
```powershell
sam delete --stack-name saans-compass
```
